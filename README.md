# LCModel Library

## Description

The library for the SIL Language and Culture Model.
The liblcm library is the core [FieldWorks](github.com/sillsdev/FieldWorks) model for linguistic analyses of languages.
Tools in this library provide the ability to store and interact with language and culture data, including anthropological,
text corpus, and linguistics data.

## Instructions

1. Install Required Software

	- git
	- Visual Studio 2019 (with C++), MonoDevelop, or JetBrains Rider

2. Clone the liblcm repository

	- Open a terminal (or git bash on Windows) and cd into a desired directory.
	- Run `git clone https://github.com/sillsdev/liblcm.git`

3. Build liblcm

	- cd into the directory of the cloned liblcm repository.

	### On Windows

	- Run the appropriate `vsvars*.bat`. Alternatively, `LCM.sln` can be built from within Visual Studio.
	- Run `build.cmd` to build the liblcm library.

	### On Linux

	- Run `build.sh` to build the liblcm library.

By default, this will build liblcm in the Debug configuration.
To build with a different configuration, use:

```bash
build.(cmd|sh) (Debug|Release)
```

## Debugging

The LCModel library consumes multiple libpalaso files as NuGet packages. FieldWorks and other projects consume LCModel as a NuGet package. Several options to debug across NuGet dependencies are discussed on [this wiki](https://github.com/sillsdev/libpalaso/wiki/Developing-with-locally-modified-nuget-packages). To publish and consume LCModel through local sources:

  * Set an enviroment variable `LOCAL_NUGET_REPO` with the path to a folder on your computer (or local network) to publish locally-built packages
  * See [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/hosting-packages/local-feeds) to enable local package sources
  * `build /t:pack` will pack nuget packages and publish them to `LOCAL_NUGET_REPO`

## Tests

### Linux

```bash
(. environ && cd artifacts/Debug/ && ICU_DATA="IcuData/" nunit-console SIL.LCModel*Tests.dll )
```
